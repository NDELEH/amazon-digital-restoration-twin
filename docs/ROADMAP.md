# Project Roadmap

This project is a **student-built, synthetic-data concept model** inspired by Lancaster University's research on Amazon forest disturbance.

Below are planned enhancements:

## Phase 1 — Core Improvements
- Add basic visualization notebooks (Jupyter)
- Improve the restoration simulation with additional trait interactions
- Add more synthetic biodiversity layers (e.g., seed dispersers, pollinators)

## Phase 2 — Ecological Realism
- Introduce spatial structure (plots → grid cells)
- Add fire probability modeling
- Add soil–water–vegetation feedback loops

## Phase 3 — Digital Twin Expansion
- Integrate a simple climate model (temperature, rainfall shifts)
- Add AI/ML model to predict disturbance risk
- Add evolutionary diversity metrics (phylogenetic trees)

## Phase 4 — Outreach & Collaboration
- Publish a project summary as a blog post
- Invite contributions from ecology/data-science students
- Share project with researchers (Lancaster University team)

This roadmap is open-ended and will evolve as the project grows.
